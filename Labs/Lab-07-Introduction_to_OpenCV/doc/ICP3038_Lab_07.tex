\section*{Laboratory 7: Introduction to OpenCV}


The aims of today's lab are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Install OpenCV;
	\item Create a project using CMake;
	\item Display an image using OpenCV;
	\item Convert from RGB to luminance;
	\item Convert from \verb|unsigned char| to \verb|float|;
	\item Save an image into a file;
	\item Apply some basic filtering techniques.
\end{itemize}

To achieve these goals, we will create several programs:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \verb+displayImage.cxx+:   A simple program using OpenCV to open an image and display it in a window;
	\item \verb+rgb2grey.cxx+:       A program to convert a RGB image in a greyscale image using OpenCV;
	\item \verb+meanFilter.cpp+:     A program to perform the mean filter using OpenCV;
	\item \verb+logScale.cxx+:       A program to display an image in the log scale;
	\item \verb+medianFilter.cpp+:   A program to perform the median filter using OpenCV;
	\item \verb+gaussianFilter.cpp+: A program to perform the Gaussian filter using OpenCV.
\end{enumerate}

Some test images are provided in the \verb+images+ directory.

\section{Installing OpenCV}
\label{sec:Installing OpenCV}
Before using OpenCV, you have to make sure it is installed on the machine you are using. 
\textbf{If it is a University's PC, we will consider that it is installed (so skip this section).}

%done and you can ignore this section. 
%If not OpenCV has to be installed. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item On Mac, OpenCV is available via Homebrew (\verb+brew install opencv3+), Fink and Macports;
 \item Most Linux distributions have packages for OpenCV. Make sure you install the \verb+-devel+ package;
 \item There are pre-compiled versions on \url{http://www.opencv.org/} that can be used on Windows. 
	 \begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Go to OpenCV's website} at \url{http://www.opencv.org/}. 
	\item \textbf{Download the latest version of OpenCV 3} (i.e.~3.4.5): On the top (see Figure~\ref{fig:main_page}), there is a link called `RELEASES', or just click on \url{https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/3.4.5/opencv-3.4.5-vc14_vc15.exe/download}. 
		\begin{figure}[tbp]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{opencv_mainpage.png}
			\caption{\label{fig:main_page}OpenCV's website.}
		\end{figure}
%	\item \textbf{Move the file} on \verb+C:+ drive using the File Explorer to avoid using the network (to speed-up the process). 
	\item \textbf{Run the file} and extract the library in \verb+C:+ drive. % (see Figure~\ref{fig:c drive}). 
	%\begin{figure}[tbp]
		%\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{C_drive.png}
		%\caption{\label{fig:c drive}Installing OpenCV on the C: drive.}
	%\end{figure}

	\item \textbf{Job done:} There is a new directory called \verb+opencv+ in the \verb+C:+ drive.  
		 \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\section{Using CMake}

As some of you will use
\begin{itemize}
 \item MS Windows on the University's computers,
 \item MS Windows on their own computer(s),
 \item Mac OS X, and
 \item Linux
\end{itemize}
it is important to keep in mind portability and we saw that toolchains can help us achieve it. 
CMake is an example of toolchain that is user friendly. 

I provided a \verb+CMakeLists.txt+ file that will work on most platforms. 
\lstinputlisting[language=bash,caption=CMakeLists.txt.,label=lst:cmake]{../src/CMakeLists.txt}

Configuring the project on MS Windows using the lab machines is relatively straightforward after following the instructions provided in Section~\ref{sec:Installing OpenCV} (see Figure~\ref{fig:config proj}). 
	\begin{figure}[tbhp]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{cmake}
	\caption{\label{fig:config proj}Project configuration using CMake.}

\section{Opening and Displaying an Image}


\subsection{Headers}


\begin{lstlisting}[language=c++,caption=Header files.]
#include <exception> // Header for catching exceptions
#include <iostream>  // Header to display text in the console
#include <opencv2/opencv.hpp> // Main OpenCV header
\end{lstlisting}

OpenCV uses exceptions. To catch them, we need \verb+<exception>+. 
To display text in the console \verb+<iostream>+ is required. 
The main OpenCV header is \verb+<opencv2/opencv.hpp>+.


\subsection{Main structure}

As stated previously, OpenCV uses exceptions. 
We can (or should) catch them to handle errors. 
The structure of the main is shown in Listing~\ref{lst:displayImage}.

\lstinputlisting[language=c++,caption=Initial program to display an image using OpenCV.,label=lst:displayImage,firstline=49,lastline=92,label=lst:displayImage]{../src/displayImage.cxx}


\subsection{Arguments of the Command Line}

The first program only takes one parameter. 
It corresponds to the path of an image file. To make sure the number of arguments is correct, you can use:

 \begin{lstlisting}[language=c++,caption=Checking the number of command line arguments.]
       // No file to display
        if (argc != 2)
        {
            // Create an error message
            std::string error_message;
            error_message  = "usage: ";
            error_message += argv[0];
            error_message += " <input_image>";

            // Throw an error
            throw error_message;
        }
\end{lstlisting}

To get the file name, you can use:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c++,caption=Getting the file name from the command line arguments.]
std::string input_filename(argv[1]);
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Reading the File}

An image is stored in an instance of the class  \verb+Mat+. 
Note that OpenCV's namespace is \verb+cv::+. 
To declare the variable that will hold our image, type:
 \begin{lstlisting}[language=c++]
        // Create an image instance
        cv::Mat image;
\end{lstlisting}

In OpenCV 2 and 3, the image is loaded using:
 \begin{lstlisting}[language=c++,caption=Open an image with OpenCV2 and 3.]
        // Open and read the image
        image = cv::imread( input_filename, CV_LOAD_IMAGE_COLOR );
\end{lstlisting}

In OpenCV 4, the image is loaded using:
 \begin{lstlisting}[language=c++,caption=Open an image with OpenCV4.]
        // Open and read the image
        image = cv::imread( input_filename, cv::IMREAD_COLOR );
\end{lstlisting}

As a consequence, we can use the C pre-porcessor to make sure our code is compatible with either version of OpenCV:
 \begin{lstlisting}[language=c++,caption=Open an image with any version of OpenCV.]
        // Open and read the image
#if CV_MAJOR_VERSION == 2
        image = cv::imread( input_filename, CV_LOAD_IMAGE_COLOR );
#elif CV_MAJOR_VERSION == 3
        image = cv::imread( input_filename, CV_LOAD_IMAGE_COLOR );
#elif CV_MAJOR_VERSION == 4
        image = cv::imread( input_filename, cv::IMREAD_COLOR );
#endif
\end{lstlisting}

It is a good practice to check if any error occurred, e.g.~to avoid unspecified behaviours and crashed. 
If the image is not loaded, its \verb+data+ field is empty. 
If it is the case we can throw an error as follows:
 \begin{lstlisting}[language=c++,caption=Check that the image contains data]
        // The image has not been loaded
        if (!image.data)
        {
            // Create an error message
            std::string error_message;
            error_message  = "Could not open or find the image \"";
            error_message += input_filename;
            error_message += "\".";

            // Throw an error
            throw error_message;
        }
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Displaying the Image}

There are four steps to create a window and display and image:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Create a string to contain the window title (it is used to identify the window);
 \item Create the window;
 \item Show the image in the window;
 \item Wait for a user input to leave the window.
\end{enumerate}

It can be done as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c++,caption=Create an image.]
        // Create a string to contain the window title
        string window_title;
        window_title  = "Display \"";
        window_title += input_filename;
        window_title += "\"";

        // Create the window
        cv::namedWindow(window_title, cv::WINDOW_AUTOSIZE);

        // Show the image in the window
        cv::imshow(window_title, image);

        // Wait for a user input to leave the window
        cv::waitKey(0);
\end{lstlisting}

The program is now complete. 
You can compile it and run it with different image files to test it.
Figure~\ref{fig:displayImage} shows a screenshot of the program. 

    \begin {figure}[htb]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{displayImage}
      \caption{\label{fig:displayImage}Screenshot of \textbf{displayImage}.}
    \end {figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Convert a RGB Image in a Greyscale Image}

Copy the main function of \verb+displayImage.cxx+ into \verb+rgb2grey.cxx+.

\subsection{Arguments of the Command Line}

The second program takes two parameter:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item  The path of the input RGB image file, and
 \item  The path of the output greyscale image file.
\end{enumerate}
Modify the code accordingly. 


\subsection{Converting from RGB to Greyscale}

After displaying the RGB image and BEFORE \verb+cv::waitKey(0)+, create a new image called \verb+grey_image+. 
To convert the original image in greyscale, simply type:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c++,caption=Convert the colour model of the image in OpenCV2 and 3.]
        // If the image is not a greyscale image, then convert it.
        cv::Mat grey_image;
        cv::cvtColor(image, grey_image, CV_RGB2GRAY);
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=c++,caption=Convert the colour model of the image in OpenCV4.]
        // If the image is not a greyscale image, then convert it.
        cv::Mat grey_image;
        cv::cvtColor(image, grey_image, cv::COLOR_RGB2GRAY);
\end{lstlisting}

In OpenCV in general, the first argument is the input image; the second argument is the output image; other arguments are the parameters of the function. 
Now create another window where to display the new image. 

\subsection{Saving an Image into a File}

The function to save an image is \verb+cv::imwrite(file_name, image)+. 
It returns true if the file has been successfully written; false otherwise. 
We can use the return value to handle possible errors:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c++,caption=Save an image.]
        // Write the image
        if (!cv::imwrite(argv[2], grey_image))
        {
            // The image has not been written

            // Create an error message
            std::string error_message;
            error_message  = "Could not write the image \"";
            error_message += argv[2];
            error_message += "\".";

            // Throw an error
            throw error_message;
        }
\end{lstlisting}
Calling \verb+rgb2grey lena_color_512.tif lena.png+ should produce the output presented in Figure~\ref{fig:grey}.
    \begin {figure}[htb]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{cc}
		\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{lena_color_512}&
		\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{lena_grey}\\
		(a) Input image. & (b) Output image.
	\end{tabular}
      \caption{\label{fig:grey}Input and output of \textbf{rgb2grey}.}
    \end {figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Mean Filter}

Let us consider the mean filter. 
Copy parts of the main function of \verb+rgb2grey.cxx+ into \verb+meanFilter.cxx+.
The new program will take 3 inputs: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The input image;
	\item The output image; and
	\item The convolution kernel radius.
\end{enumerate}
To convert a C string into an integer, use the \verb+atoi+ function from the \verb+<cstdlib>+ header. 
It will be needed to get the kernel radius from the command line argument. 
To set the kernel size, you need to use an instance of the \verb+cv::Size+ class. 
You also have to specify its size. 
You can use:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c++]
// Filter size
cv::Size filter_size(kernel_width, kernel_height);
\end{lstlisting}
or 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c++]
// Filter size
cv::Size filter_size;
filter_size.width = kernel_width;
filter_size.height = kernel_height;
\end{lstlisting}
Note that 
\begin{itemize}
	\item If the radius is 0, then the kernel size is $1\times1$    
	\item If the radius is 1, then the kernel size is $3\times3$    
	\item If the radius is 2, then the kernel size is $5\times5$    
	\item ...
	\item If the radius is 7, then the kernel size is $15\times15$    
	\item etc.
\end{itemize}
Now you are ready to filter the input image. Use either \verb+cv::blur+ or \verb+cv::boxFilter+. 
They are the same. 
The first argument is the input image; the second is the output image; and the third one is the kernel size. 
Display and save the output image. 
Try different kernel sizes to see the differences (see Figure~\ref{fig:boxFilter}). 

    \begin {figure}[htb]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{cc}
		\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{lena_R1}&
		\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{lena_R2}\\
		(a) Radius = 1. & (b) Radius = 2.\\[1em]
		\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{lena_R5}&
		\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{lena_R50}\\
		(c) Radius = 5. & (d) Radius = 50.
	\end{tabular}
      \caption{\label{fig:boxFilter}Outputs of \textbf{meanFilter}.}
    \end {figure}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\section{Median Filter}
%
%You can also use a median filter. 
%In this can, no instance of  \verb+cv::Size+ is required. 
%Just use \verb+cv::medianBlur+. 
%The first argument is the input image; the second is the output image; and the third one is an odd number which corresponds to the kernel size. 
%Try different kernel sizes to see the differences. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\section{Gaussian Filter}
%
%Finally, let us try the Gaussian filter. 
%You will need 4 parameters from the command line:
%input file, output file, kernel radius and $\sigma$.
%Just like the mean filter, an instance of \verb+cv::Size+ is needed as the Gaussian filter is a convolution. 
%The first three parameters of \verb+cv::GaussianBlur+ are consistent. 
%The fourth and fifth are the horizontal and vertical $\sigma$ values. 
%Try different kernel sizes and different  $\sigma$ values to see the differences. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Display an Image in the Log Scale}

The main function of \verb+rgb2grey.cxx+ into \verb+logScale.cxx+ as it is important to use a greyscale image in this new program. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:log} shows the shape of the $\log$ function. 
    \begin {figure}[htb]
      \begin{center}
        \input{log}
      \end{center}
      \caption{\label{fig:log}The $\log$ function.}
    \end {figure}
Looking at the $y$ axis, we note that it is important to store the image using floating point numbers. 
If we don't, there will be enormous quantisation problems. 

To convert the greyscale image from \verb+unsigned char+ to \verb+float+, we use:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c++,caption=Convert an image into floating point numbers.]
        // Convert to float
        cv::Mat float_image;
        grey_image.convertTo(float_image, CV_32FC1);
\end{lstlisting}

It can be seen on the figure that $\log(x) \forall x \in ]-\infty,  0]$ is undefined. 
In other word, if $x$ is equal to zero or $x$ is negative, then there is no $y$ value. 
As the input image was using \verb+unsigned char+, we do not have to worry about negative values. 
However, we have to make sure no $0$ value is present in the image. 
To do so, we apply the following transformation:
\begin{equation}f'(x,y) = \log(f(x,y) + 1)\end{equation}
using
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c++]
        // Log transformation
        cv::Mat log_image;
        cv::log(float_image + 1.0, log_image);
\end{lstlisting}

Looking at the curve, we notice another problem. 
In some case, $\log(x)$ may be negative. 
In this case, it is common to normalise the image so that its values lie in the range $[0, 1]$ using:
\begin{equation}f''(x,y) = \frac{f'(x,y) - \min(f')}{\max(f') - \min(f')}\label{eq:normal}\end{equation}

There are two ways to achieve this in OpenCV.
You can implement Eq.~\ref{eq:normal} using:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c++]
        double min, max;
        cv::minMaxLoc(log_image, &min, &max);
        cv::Mat normalised_image = 255.0 * (log_image - min) / (max - min);
        normalised_image.convertTo(normalised_image, CV_8UC1);
\end{lstlisting}
or you can use OpenCV's function:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c++]
        // Normalisation
        cv::Mat normalised_image;
        cv::normalize(log_image, normalised_image, 0, 255, cv::NORM_MINMAX, CV_8UC1);
\end{lstlisting}

Now you can display and save the image (see Figure~\ref{fig:logFilter}.
    
        \begin {figure}[htb]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{cc}
		\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{lake}&
		\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{lake_log}\\
		(a) Input image. & (b) Output image.
	\end{tabular}
      \caption{\label{fig:logFilter}Input and output of \textbf{logScale}.}
    \end {figure}
